This React component utilizes the `useState` hook to manage its state. However, the update to `count` occurs within a function which is not directly called. The `setCount` function is defined correctly, but the code lacks the invocation that would actually trigger the state update.  Therefore the UI never reflects changes to the `count` variable.
